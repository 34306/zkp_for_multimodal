# zkp_for_multimodal
This repo contains some library for the research about Zero-Knowledge Proof for Multimodal (multi AI models with multi input data)

### For the Finite Field calculation, we use [libff](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libff) by [scipr-lab](https://github.com/scipr-lab)
### For the Model Predictive Control (MPC), we use [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit)

### For the original paper that lead to our implementation, we want to refer to [zknn-D209](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/zknn-D209)
